apt-offline - Offline APT Package manager
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>apt-offline</B>

[ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

apt-offline brings
offline package management functionality to Debian based system.  It can be
used to download packages and its dependencies to be installed later on (or
required to update) a disconnected machine.  Packages can be downloaded from a
different connected machine.
<P>
<P>

It can also fetch bug reports for the packages that are downloaded.
<P>

Unless the -h/-v or --help/--version options are given, one of the
<B>get, set</B>

or
<B>install</B>

commands must be provided.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>set FILENAME [-h] [--install-packages PKG...PKG_N] [--install-src-packages PKG...PKG_N] --src-build-dep [--release release_name] [--update] [--upgrade] [--upgrade-type upgrade]</H3>

<P>
<P>

<B>set</B>

generates a signature file with the data required to install on or update the
disconnected machine.
<P>
<B>FILENAME {apt-offline.sig}</B>

is the signature file generated on the machine. This file will contain all the
information necessary for apt.

Generate APT Database signature for an update. This is the equivalent of using
<B>apt-get update</B>

<P>
<DT><B>--upgrade</B><DD>
Generate APT Database signature for package upgrade. This is the equivalent of using
<B>apt-get upgrade</B>

<P>

<B>upgrade.</B>

Other valid types are

<H3>get FILENAME [-h] [--socket-timeout ] [-d / --download-dir] [-s / --cache-dir] [--no-checksum] [-t / --threads ] [--bundle] [--bug-reports] [--proxy-host] [--proxy-port] [--https-cert-file --https-key-file] [--http-basicauth] [--disable-cert-check]</H3>

<P>
<P>

<B>get</B>

downloads APT data as per a signature file.
<P>
<B>FILENAME {apt-offline.sig}</B>

is the signature file required for details about data to be downloaded. This
file should have been generated by the above
<B>set</B>

command.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d, --download-dir DIR_NAME</B><DD>
Download data to the specified DIR_NAME folder. If no folder name is specified, data is downloaded to a folder in the TEMPDIR path in the format
<B>apt-offline-download-$PID</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-s, --cache-dir DIR_NAME</B><DD>
Look for data in the cache before downloading it from the internet. If you are on a Debian box, you would want to specify
<I>/var/cache/apt/archives</I>

here. If the data is not available in the cache, the downloaded data is also copied to the cache.
<P>
<DT><B>--no-checksum</B><DD>
Enabling this option will bypass the checksum verification of each downloaded file thus losing integrity of the package. Usage of this option is highly discouraged
<P>
<DT><B>-t, --threads NUM_OF_THREADS</B><DD>
Number of threads to spawn for downloads. Default is 1. Using too many threads can overload the servers, hence it is advisable to keep the number low
<P>
<DT><B>--bundle FILENAME</B><DD>
Create an archive file FILENAME. The file is archived in zip format
<P>
<DT><B>--bug-reports</B><DD>

<DT><B>--https-cert-file FILENAME</B><DD>
The Certificate-file to use if https-client-authentication is required on one or multiple hosts.
<P>
<DT><B>--https-key-file FILENAME</B><DD>
The Certificate-key-file to use if https-client-authentication is required on one or multiple hosts.
<P>
<DT><B>--disable-cert-check</B><DD>
Disable the check of https certificates on servers
<P>
<DT><B>--http-basicauth URL</B><DD>
A username/password encoded in the URL. Note Passwords with special characters should be percent encoded as per RFC-3986 section 2.1
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>install FILE/FOLDER [-h] [--skip-bug-reports ] [--install-src-path PATH] [--allow-unauthenticated]</H3>

<P>
<P>

<B>install</B>

installs APT data to the APT package database and updates it.
<P>
<B>FILE {archive_bundle_file}</B>

Install data from the archive (bundle) file.
<P>
<B>FOLDER {/folder/path}</B>

Install data from the folder path.
<P>
Either FILE or FOLDER argument can be provided to the
<B>install</B>

command.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--simulate<DD>
Developer only. Used for testing.
<P>
<DT><B>--skip-bug-reports</B><DD>
Skip listing of downloaded bug reports, if any.
<P>
<DT><B>--skip-changelog</B><DD>
Skip display of changelog, if any.
<P>
<DT><B>--allow-unauthenticated</B><DD>
Don't verify GPG signatures for the data to be installed to APT. Usage of this option is highly discouraged.
<P>
<DT><B>--strict-deb-check</B><DD>
With this option enabled, apt-offline delegate's .deb package checksum validation to apt. While the .debs are
already available, they are stored in the temporary apt cache, where apt validates its checksum, before considering
it for further processing.
Note: This does have the caveat that apt may need network availability even though it doesn't download anything over the network. But it does invoke the download routines and realizes that the payload is already available. It then further proceeds with checksum validation
<P>
The default behavior is to
<B>not</B>

do strict checksum validation for .deb files. Instead, apt-offline copies the .deb files to apt's download location. apt still does size validation of the available .deb files and discards them in case there is a mismatch.
<P>
<DT><B>--install-src-path PATH</B><DD>
Path to filesystem where we want the source packages to be installed to. Default will be a folder in your TEMPDIR.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>NOTE: argument/option handling</B>

<DD>
apt-offline relies on argparse for argument/option parsing. To explicitly instruct apt-offline about an argument, you can pass it with the -- delimiter.
<P>
<B>Ex. apt-offline set --update --upgrade --install-packages wm2 -- foo.sig</B>

<P>
By specifying the
<B>--</B>

delimiter, we instruct apt-offline that foo.sig is an argument to the
<B>apt-offline</B>

command and not to the
<B>--install-packages</B>

option.
<P>
Otherwise, you could also use it positionally next to the set command
<P>
<B>Ex. apt-offline set foo.sig --update --upgrade --install-packages wm2</B>

<P>
<DT><B>apt-offline set FILENAME</B>

<DD>
This command will generate a signature file FILENAME for APT Package Database.
To generate only the signature for updates, use the --update option.  To
generate only the signature for package upgrades, use the --upgrade option.
<P>
<DT><B>apt-offline get FILENAME</B>

<DD>
This command will fetch the data required for APT Package Database as per the
signature file FILENAME generated by
<B>apt-offline get.</B>

To download bug reports also use the --bug-reports option.  Currently supported bug tracker is Debian BTS only.
By default, if neither of -d or --bundle options are specified, apt-offline downloads data into a folder inside the TEMPDIR environment folder in the format apt-offline-downloads-PID, where PID is the PID of the running apt-offline process. Example on a Linux machine would be something like: /tmp/apt-offline-downloads-23242/
<P>
<DT><B>apt-offline install FILE|FOLDER</B>

<DD>
This command will sync the data downloaded by
<B>apt-offline get</B>

to the APT Package Database and update it.
Depending on where the data was downloaded to or packed into, either the
absolute FOLDER path or the archive FILE path can be specified.
<P>
<B>NOTE1:</B>

On a freshly installed box, that was installed without the network, the package database is null. In that case, you first need to run
<B>apt-offline</B>

with just the
<B>--update</B>

option to ensure you have a meaningful package database
<P>
<B>Example: apt-offline set set.uris --update</B>

<P>
<B>NOTE2:</B>

On a fresh setup installed through CD/DVD, the default APT setting lists only the install media URLs. In such case, you need to add the default APT network repositories to the list. For example, for a fresh (DVD) installed Debian box, add the relevant repository to
<P>
<I>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-offline.list or /etc/apt/sources.list</I>

<P>
<DT>Sequence 2: With successful completion of Sequence 1, the APT database on the disconnected machine will be up-to-date. Now, the following set of commands, when run in sequence, will upgrade a disconnected machine.<DD>

<P>
(Installs the data needed to upgrade the upgradable packages. Should be run on the disconnected machine)

and
<B>Sequence 2</B>

in order, further running
<B>apt-get upgrade</B>
